1	From fairest creatures we desire increase,	s
2	With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:	s
3	His tender heir might bear his memory:	s
4	But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	s
5	Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	s
6	Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	s
7	Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	s
8	And only herald to the gaudy spring,	s
9	Within thine own bud buriest thy content	s
10	And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	s
11	Implored to change for senseless rest 	b
12	How still, how happy ! These are words 	b
13	And what is thine that it should prove 	b
14	And fresh winds shook the door ; 	b
15	That I shall greet them ne'er again ! ' 	b
16	Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain ; 	b
17	And conquered good and conquering ill 	b
18	Gladly to see his gory sun 	b
19	Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave- 	b
20	Is human love so true ? 	b
21	Implored to change for senseless rest 	b
